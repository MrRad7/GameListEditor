Game List XML Editor for EmulationStation

Processes XML lists of games for EmulationStation allowing you to filter out games that are not known "good" or "mature" games.
Currently works for mame, atari, fba, nes, snes, and mega

This isn't the best of code, but it was a quick way for me to process large XML files and filter out the games I didn't want my kid playing.
